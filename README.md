=== My Vim Setup ===

To setup vim just run the setup.sh script.

=== Requirements ===
  - git
  - wget
  - Linux system

This script will then install all the bundles listed in the vimrc file.


NOTE: If you use vim as your default editor, make sure you update your alternatives to be something other then vim.tiny. 
(i.e. vim.nox)
